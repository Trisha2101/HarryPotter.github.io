<h3>The Chamber Of Secrets</h3>
<p>Before their second year at Hogwarts the Weasley's (Ron, Fred and George) flew to 4 Privet drive in Mr. Weasley's flying car to pick up Harry. Harry was dealing with a house elf (Dobby) at his home and got in trouble so his Uncle Vernon put bars on his windows. The Weasley's got him out of there and took him to the burrow where he stayed for the rest of the summer. When it was time to get school supplies the Weasleys and Harry went to Diagon Ally and met Hermione and Mr. and Mrs. Granger. They bumped into Draco Malfoy and his dad and Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Weasley got into a fight. After all the school supplies were bought they were off to Hogwarts. They met their new defence against the dark arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart. Lockhart was a famous author and everyone was so excited to get their teachers autograph. Harry was in detention when he started hearing an ear piercing voice. He told his friends and they were extremely concerned. When they walked to their dorms, they passed a petrified Mrs. Norris (a cat who was owned by a teacher who hated harry and his friends). On the wall near the cat was red writing that said "The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware." Later, during a DADA class Harry was speaking parseltounge and everyone thought Harry was the heir of Slytherin and avoided him.  One by one many students started to become petrified and they were not allowed to go around the castle alone. Sadly, Hermione was one of the students that was petrified. Harry found a diary that could talk to him and learned it was once owned by a young student of Hogwarts named Tom Riddle.  This went overboard when one of the students was taken and teachers needed a solution. So they trusted Gilderoy Lockhart who was proved to be lying about all his adventures. Harry, Ron and Lockhart went into the chamber, where Lockhart lost his memory due to a spell that he cast. Harry continued on to the chamber and met Tom Riddle. Harry saw Ginny laying on the floor of the chamber </p>
